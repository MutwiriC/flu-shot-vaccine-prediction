    "\n",
    "Seasonal influenza continues to pose significant health risks despite the availability of effective vaccines. However, vaccination rates remain suboptimal in many populations, suggesting the presence of behavioral, informational, and structural barriers to uptake.\n",

    "**Stakeholder:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Public Health Division\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Current public health vaccination campaigns are often broad and population-wide. While this approach maximizes exposure, it can lead to inefficiencies:\n",
    "* Resources may be distributed across individuals who would vaccinate regardless.\n",
    "* Vaccine-hesitant populations may remain unengaged.\n",
    "* Outreach efforts may lack personalization based on behavioral or demographic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises a key strategic question:\n",
    "**Can we identify individuals who are least likely to receive a flu vaccine, so that outreach efforts can be more targeted and efficient?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering this question, public health agencies can allocate resources more effectively and design interventions that address specific barriers to vaccination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build predictive classification models that estimate the probability that an individual receives:\n",
    "* The H1N1 vaccine\n",
    "* The seasonal flu vaccine\n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions can support:\n",
    "* More targeted communication campaigns\n",
    "* Better understanding of behavioral drivers of vaccination."

    "**Dataset Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project originates from the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey. It contains survey responses collected to understand vaccination behavior during the H1N1 influenza outbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is structured into separate files:\n",
    "* training_set_features.csv – Contains demographic, behavioral, and health-related features.\n",
    "* training_set_labels.csv – Contains the target variables indicating vaccine uptake.\n",

    "**Target Variables:**\n",

    "* h1n1_vaccine\n",

    "**Feature Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The training_set_features.csv dataset contains:\n",
    "* Demographic information (age, education level, employment status)\n",
    "* Health-related conditions\n",
    "* Behavioral indicators (preventive measures, doctor recommendations)\n",
    "* Risk perception\n",
    "* Opinion-based responses"
